  Hello Stu.xyz
</h1>
<p>Just my little personal website</p>

## ðŸš€ To-do list

- update config, migrate content, styling on posts, post-lists - done
- update styling on tag pages to match - done
- Design and make new home page - done
- update other styles - done
- footer and nav
- Migrate the about me page
- Improve Bio component
- deploy on firebase using github actions
- update twitter and open graph in seo component to use postImage or fallback gracefully to an icon use || ?
- add in some analytics

## Maybe things for later (Roadmap)

- look at react leaflet and play with maps again
- go through and selectively import bulma sass files need. Rather than all.
- Split out Layout Component to create Layout, Header/Nav and Footer?!
