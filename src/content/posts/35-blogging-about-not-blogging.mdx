This post was inspired by Jukesieâ€™s post - [Introducing bloggers about blogging](https://digitalbydefault.com/2024/05/12/introducing-bloggers-about-blogging/)

Iâ€™ve _kind of_ blogged for many years, but itâ€™s always in fits and starts, and the writing habit seldom sticks for long. I don't think I could call myself a _proper_ blogger. 

The few periods where Iâ€™ve successfully hit any cadence or habit over time have usually coincided with a photographic project. My longest streak was my 365days project where I shared a self-portrait and blog post every day for a year on Flickr. I also had a long-running series of #seenonmyrun posts back in the early days of my running obsession. Those were all shared on a Tumblr-esque platform I canâ€™t recall the name of. At some point, they were all migrated onto one of the many WordPress sites Iâ€™ve had in the past, all long since retired. Although these endeavours are a form of blogging the photograph is the star of the show and not the written word.

I find writing hard. Iâ€™ve increasingly become convinced I have some form of dyslexia and thatâ€™s partly the reason Iâ€™ve been experimenting with [audio-notes](/podcasts). I mostly take solace in the fact that I havenâ€™t ever totally given up. Most of the content Iâ€™ve created still exists in one form or another even if not published online. Going back through it all forms a fascinating historical record of my life, thoughts and experiences. I find that those records can be really valuable, especially if your memory is as awful as mine! Writing has also become a handy tool for making sense of and organising my thoughts and feelings. For these reasons and despite my repeated failures to hit a consistent rhythm, Iâ€™m unlikely to give up trying anytime soon.

I thought it'd be fun to spend a few minutes reflecting on my writing process and what takes me the most time in the hope that it might help me unblock the reasons Iâ€™m not blogging more frequently. The less-than-scientific results of this exercise are visualised below.

A pie chart wasn't really needed was it? no...but I did enjoy making it!

I spend a lot of time â€˜Worrying too much about other people and their reactionsâ€™. This includes much self-doubt and overthinking the value of anything I might write or share. Iâ€™m certain Iâ€™ve never had an original thought. This isnâ€™t a surprise, and I know Iâ€™m not alone. Iâ€™ve had this conversation with lots of people on numerous occasions. In fact, [Mathew Wilson](https://documenteering.com/) and I discussed it just the other week.

I love Jukesieâ€™s advice hereâ€¦
> â€œDonâ€™t fear the publish button â€“ dance like nobody is watching and blog like nobody is readingâ€¦because usually they arenâ€™t. . .Write for yourself. . ." - Matt Jukes

This particularly resonates because that IS my approach to dancing - Itâ€™s why disco is one of my nicknames. So applying this same technique to writing feels both plausible and an opportunity for fun. This was also a consideration in the redesign of my website that I [wrote about yesterday](/posts/building-things/). I want my blog to be about me and for me primarily. I'd benefit from spending far less time getting hung up on whether what I post is â€˜good enoughâ€™. If anybody else reads them and finds them helpful, that's just a bonus. 

Time spent correcting mistakes is my next biggest hurdle to overcome. I was using [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) for a time, which was useful, but I also found it quite annoying, popping up in all sorts of places across my Mac. I may revisit the app and spend some time fine-tuning the settings. If anybody has any suggestions for alternatives, though, please let me know. 

Anyway - I've managed to blog about not blogging. Which means I am actually blogging and not, not blogging...or something like that? ðŸ¤¯ I'm going to dance over and smash the publish button now - 'cos hopefully nobody is reading this nonsense anyway ðŸ˜œ
