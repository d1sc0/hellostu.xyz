![A bright red glowing light beam is focussed across my face. I use my hand to block the glare](../post_images/52weeks/52_2023_10_FULL.jpg)

I am seemingly starring in my own science fiction [b-movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie) this week. It’s an idea that emerged while I was playing with a set of [barn doors](https://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/05/barn-doors-and-blue-dragons.html) and some coloured gels on my flash. I’m not sure if the world were to be invaded by body-snatching aliens, I’d be that high up on their priority list?! You can never be sure, though. I’ll head to the shops for a new tinfoil hat tomorrow, just in case.

### The second half of life

I’ve been reflecting recently on what I want, need and am working towards. The current, truthful answer is ‘not much!’. Without really noticing, success has snuck up on me. Most of the goals I previously worked so hard for have been accomplished. I’m married, have successfully raised a child, cleared most of our debts, ventured onto the property ladder, ran marathons, landed a pretty good job doing meaningful work, had some pleasant holidays, made good friends, etc. etc. Life isn’t perfect, but it is pretty good. I wouldn’t have even dreamt of many things I’ve accomplished now in my late teens…so what do I focus on next?

I’ve been recently introduced to some of Carl Jung’s thinking on the two halves of life. I’m 43, so it would be accurate to describe myself as entering the second half. He’s quoted as saying.

> “The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it”

Going inward and letting go sounds scary, but something in this resonates, and this second half might be a good time to explore new things. Some of this exploration might need to focus inward. I’m unsure what this might involve (I’m unlikely to go the candles and chanting route), but I want to keep my mind open and try different things.

One of the things I’m currently considering to get me started is reducing my working hours. I _think_ we can just about afford for me to drop a day each week. This would give me more time to rest, indulge in my creative hobbies, and invest time in this further exploration of self. I’ve started checking my financial assumptions and if my employer is happy to support this. The whole idea is starting to feel quite exciting, so I’ll tell you what happens.

### Random recommendations

I’m very late to the party, but this week I enjoyed watching [The Responder](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0b61z9j/the-responder) on BBC iPlayer. It’s a bit tense in places, but a good storyline and strong performances make it a great watch. I’ve also been relistening to two of my favourite audiobooks, [Utopia for Realists](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Utopia-for-Realists-Audiobook/B01N6WPVDL) and [Humankind](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Humankind-Audiobook/1526620944?ref=a_author_Ru_c9_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=af5062e9-57de-425c-9e02-6d8ad006b9aa&pf_rd_r=PYHA6DRPS57J82922W01&pageLoadId=mwUQBK1KMkTrvutc&creativeId=83220593-1d50-4883-bad4-b5d505543719), both written by [Rutger Bregman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman). I highly recommend them both if you need a healthy dose of optimism.
