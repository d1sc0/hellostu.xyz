### Work

The work week was cut short by a two-day migraine, which followed a weekend of feeling pretty low for various reasons. I only work a four-day week when well, so there isn‚Äôt much to report from the remaining days. Highlights that stuck out;

- Given the limited time, I made significant progress on getting closer to landing the few bits of new work I nodded at last week. Two statements of work are now drafted with one client, and a draft proposal is taking shape for another. A lot of the heavy lifting has been done by my super-smart colleagues Julie and Jaskiran üß†, but I know I‚Äôve played a helpful and needed role across both pieces.
- I attended a client meeting that included interesting discussions about trialling weeknotes as a form of programme governance. Some good chat was had, and I found it interesting to see the range of reactions and interpretations of the ideas presented. I look forward to seeing how this progresses.
- We had our regular divisional ‚Äòall hands‚Äô meeting on Thursday. Jen kicked it off by sharing some wisdom, adeptly navigating some quite challenging/sensitive content and creating a short pause for folks to reflect. It felt wholesome and cheerful, and I think maybe I needed that moment, so I feel grateful üôè
- I had a few interactions with colleagues in my team this week that have made me feel more grounded and reminded me I‚Äôm in great company. I look forward to spending more time with some of them IRL next week. Equally, at times, I do look around and feel like the odd one out‚Ä¶like they are all great, and I suck. I‚Äôm hoping that little imposter anxiety voice in my head can shut the f\*\*k up; cos, frankly, I have other more important things to be anxious about right now üòÇ

### Life

- Despite my sleep cycle being all over the place, my exercise routine mostly paused, and the migraine, I‚Äôve still found moments of calm and ways to exercise mindfulness. I‚Äôve felt supported by friends, family and colleagues.
- I finally finished [Lost](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/). Possibly the worst ending of a show EVER! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs done.
- I‚Äôve re-watched too many episodes of [Enterprise](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244365/) to be healthy in one week. I‚Äôve just started re-watching [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) in anticipation of the new season. This was prompted by one of the posts listed below.
- Today, my Daughter Robyn (who will be 22 next Tuesday ü§Ø) and I visited the [Dorset Ape Rescue Centre](https://monkeyworld.org/) as a belated Father‚Äôs Day activity. I find monkeys fascinating, and normally, I come away with a memory card full of photos. Today was different, and the joy came from spending time with Robyn just being. I took about 20 photos, and the one above is the only one worth sharing.
