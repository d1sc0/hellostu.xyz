      On 18th May 2024 I'll be attempting to complete a{' '}
      <strong>58km hike (36 miles)</strong> along the Jurassic Coast from Corfe Castle
      to Weymouth. The route includes 1700m of elevation and is the first half of
      the full{' '}
      <a href="https://www.ultrachallenge.com/jurassic-coast-challenge/">
        Jurassic Coast Ultra Challenge
      </a>{' '}
      of 100km. I'm taking part to challenge myself physically and to raise funds
      for the charity <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Why I'm fundraising for Mind</h3>
    <p>
      Over the last couple of years, I have suffered through long periods of
      acute anxiety. I've also spent time caring for a close family member who
      has suffered from severe depression and reached several points of crisis.
      This journey has involved navigating the best and the worst of our
      National Health Service, hospital stays, and a mix of self-funded care and
      therapy. Dealing with these things has at times been complex and the
      information provided by Mind has been extremely helpful and a great source
      of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of Mind is important. I'm fundraising to help them in their work
      which involves;
      <ul>
        <li>
          publishing useful, accessible information about mental health illness
        </li>
        <li>campaigning and lobbying to improve legislation and services</li>
        <li>raising public awareness and understanding of issues</li>
        <li>
          running a network of mental health support services up and down the
          country
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Poor mental health can impact anybody and the work of MIND can benefit
        everybody. Please support me in my challenge and donate to MIND using
