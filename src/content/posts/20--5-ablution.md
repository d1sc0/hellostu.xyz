This evolved into a very different image from what I originally had in mind when I started shooting it but I’m pleased with how it’s turned out. I generally hate any photographs of me from this angle, but the combination of the texture and movement created by the water and the symmetrical composition makes it something I can live with sharing. When I stare at this image long enough my brain starts to imagine the outline of another person from the negative space between me(s) which is kinda cool.

The setup was fairly simple in terms of camera and lighting. The only two tricky parts were trying to get some shots I was happy with before my lens fogged up and trying to keep my iPhone as dry as possible (which was in the shower with me and being used as a remote shutter).

### Three things on my mind

1. Running - I haven’t run this week at all. I feel like a bit of a failure. I’m trying not to waste energy being annoyed with myself but I do need to rectify this tomorrow by getting out and covering some miles. I must stay on top of this.

2. Therapy - I have a session booked in with a therapist on Tuesday. I’m hopeful it’ll be more useful than my previous experiences but I’m apprehensive. If anybody has any wise words or advice for a first session then please let me know.

3. Travel - I’ll be travelling to Egypt on Friday for a mini-break by myself. I’ve started to pack and get organised but mostly my focus is on the huge amount of work I’m trying to squeeze into the 4 days I have left at work before I head off. Roll on Friday!
