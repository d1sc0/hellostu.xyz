A little bit more effort in this week’s photograph. To follow up on my intention of using this project to refresh and improve my photography skills, I purchased some new gear this week to increase my creative options. The two significant purchases that made this shot possible were a cheap flash unit and a remote trigger.

Using a [flash off-camera](https://strobist.blogspot.com/) opens up a world of possibilities but it’s not something I’ve done for several years. In the past, I had quite a collection of flash photography equipment but I let most of it go when I traded in my DSLR for my current micro-four-thirds setup.

At the moment I don’t have a shoot-through umbrella to soften the light so I decided to embrace the constraint and create a little bit of drama by placing the flash unit up on the landing above me and casting some harsh shadows through the bannister and across the wall and carpet.

I quite enjoyed shooting this. The flash unit I bought was cheaper than I remember them being. This may be because I’ve [not purchased big brand names](https://godox.com/camera-flashes/) but they seem to work well and have more features than I’ll likely need. I can see myself getting another and playing with some more complex setups later down the line. Let me know what you think of this effort in the comments section.

### Elsewhere

Work had some notable moments this week but nothing that’s easy to share or that I want to write about - I’m sure I won some, lost some and ended the week on a draw. No real complaints.

Running life has continued strong. I’ve managed about 21 miles this week across 5 runs. Today I ran [8.6 miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/8549265537) which made me feel like a proper runner! My legs feel like I ran 16 miles and I’m a little worried the next few days I’ll be hobbling about like a very old man.
