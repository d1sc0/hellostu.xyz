<p>Just my little personal website</p>

## ðŸš€ To-do list

- update styling on tag pages to match - done
- Design and make new home page - done
- update other styles - done
- tweak Bio component - done
- footer and nav - done
- Migrate the about me page - done
- deploy on firebase using github actions - done
- update twitter and open graph in seo component to use postImage - done
- add in some analytics - panelbear?
- tidy up leaflet - maybe remove gatsy leaflet and ensure components use import css?

## Maybe things for later (Roadmap)

- improve contact form error handling - maybe try using formik?
- look at react leaflet and play with maps again
- go through and selectively import bulma sass files need. Rather than all.
- Split out Layout Component to create Layout, Header/Nav and Footer?!
