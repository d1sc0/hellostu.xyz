![Trail running Stu stumbles into the distance on the ramparts of maiden castle in dorset!](../post_images/52weeks/52_2023_9_FULL.jpg)

Iâ€™m very late posting this shot. It was shot last Sunday. I opted for a simple snap on the iPhone while out for a trail run, as I had a jam-packed weekend and no time for anything grander. This is not only the second iPhone shot of the project so far, but itâ€™s also the second time an age iron hill fort has been the location. I love running around these places. They are just stunning.

I was going to accompany this picture with some thoughts from the week preceding its capture, but as Iâ€™ve now caught up with myself by posting so late, Iâ€™ll save those for a new post, hopefully landing tomorrow. See you soon ðŸ˜˜
