Iâ€™m pleased with this photograph. I like the black and white tones, the shadows and the detail captured. I changed some camera settings this weekend, making setting focus and checking the shotâ€™s framing easier. A small win, but making my workflow more efficient reduces the draw on my time. The black background is also a new addition. Iâ€™ve had an old set of background stands in the garage for some time, so itâ€™s nice to have some new fabric to hang and use finally.

### Making plans

In a previous post, I mentioned going part-time and dropping a day of work each week to explore other uses for my time. This is increasingly likely, but I havenâ€™t finalised a date for the change in the diary yet.
Last weekend I started drawing up a list of all the materials and tools I might need to extend our garden patio to give us more space for furniture and potted plants. I have no experience in laying patio slabs. Still, the youtube videos make it look like a suitable enough task for beginners, and having this extra day a week is a sufficient excuse for me not to pay someone else to do the job for me.

In addition to planning for my increased work-life balance, weâ€™ve also been putting some time into making plans for the summer. Weâ€™ve booked a few days to Vienna for Chloeâ€™s 40th birthday celebrations in August. Chloe is a big fan of Gustav Klimt, so seeing [The Kiss at the Belvedere](https://www.belvedere.at/en/kiss-gustav-klimt?) is a real treat. Iâ€™ve found a parkrun for us to complete nearby ðŸ˜‚. Anything else we do will be a bonus.

Weâ€™ve also agreed on some other dates during the Summer when we plan on camping in the UK. Iâ€™ve always had a love/hate relationship with camping, but I want to try and approach these trips differently. We wonâ€™t be accompanied by children or dogs anymore, which sets a different tone, lessens the work involved and hopefully makes it more enjoyable. For the first trip, weâ€™ll stay local and head into Devon; after that, we have Whitby and some English forests on our shortlist.

So summer plans are already taking shape. Landscaping, Vienna, UK Camping - Not to mention a [Bastille](https://www.bastillebastille.com/) concert, my own birthday weekend surprise, and what I hope will be lots of swimming trips along the Dorset coast. Letâ€™s cross our fingers that we have good weather. Oh! and Iâ€™m only one month away from my new tattoo. Exciting!
