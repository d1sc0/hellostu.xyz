So today I had a meeting to discuss, reflect on and review my first six months with FutureGov in addition to planning out the next six. It’s one of those odd milestones where you can’t quite wrap your head around the fact it’s been six months already but in equal measure it almost feels like I’ve been with the company for years.

I won’t share the finer details of the meeting but happy to report I
still have a job (so I did a few things ok!) and I have plenty left to do and
learn. I’m the type of person who would have been pretty annoyed if I didn’t
have some actions coming out of such a review so smiles all round!

One thing to reflect on is the shape of the review itself, it’s typical of the way
things are done ‘operationally’ at FutureGov and it’s one of the many things I really
love about working with them. The format was that of a simple (but documented) conversation
based around 5 short open questions. The outcome of which was both personal and super
practical. I feel like I actually get something tangible and useful from the process
and hopefully so does FutureGov. Six months in and I could almost take this approach
of minimal viable bureaucracy for granted but luckily 20 years worth of work experience
in other organisations means I still have a history of rather heavy performance management
frameworks, target setting and bizarre competency statements lodged in my brain that
allow me to appreciate and value the differences of this lightweight but mature approach.

For me personally it’s been an interesting opportunity to reflect on not only how my work is going but how my work/life balance is fairing. The primary challenge being that work and home life are for most of the week geographically apart by 130 miles (or 3 hours each way on public transport). In real terms this sees me away from my lovely wife Chloe, daughter Robyn and four-legged friend Monty for at least one 3 day block a week and working from home 2 days.
It’s not been easy for anybody involved but so far the work gets done, I feel like I’ve found a purpose, I enjoy my work but I’m still at home just often enough for my wife to keep her career on track and my daughter to feel my embarrassing presence in her life.

I’m lucky they both support me in what often feels quite a selfish pursuit! I need to work harder/smarter at making them understand how thankful I am. Maybe I should conduct a light-touch FutureGov style review with the family or if nothing else book in regular retrospectives!? ;) For the time-being I’ll just finish with a list of things I’ve learnt on this subject so far…

- We are supported by some amazing friends, neighbours & family! They just rock and have saved our bacon many many times
- Technology - tools like slack, google calendar, hangouts, snapchat and instagram are all essential to being part of home life whilst away
- FutureGov are a friendly bunch and without that I’d of gone crazy outside office hours
- I’m lucky to have a friend who is also my London landlord (Thanks Andy!)
- It’s worth having a dog just so there is always someone excited when you get home
- Remote/digital hugging is just not a thing yet! Please make it happen
- Gardening still sucks and distance does not improve this
- Scheduling fitness also sucks
- Date nights need scheduling
- Arguments with a teenager are just not the same over the phone (they just hang-up!)
- South West Trains err often suck!
- Quality time is not quality unless you turn your devices off
- Not straying into ‘good cop’/’bad cop’ parent roles is more challenging
- Squeezing in time for friends and family is a juggling act (book early to avoid disappointment)
- I’m still an extremely lucky guy to have met, seduced and married Chloe
- I have a very independent, intelligent & mostly sensible daughter (not traits inherited from me!)

I’m conscious there are people who have this balancing act nailed with years of experience. Please feel free to share any tips!
