Anyone who follows [me on twitter](https://twitter.com/_disco) will have possibly noticed that parkrun has become a bit of an obsession for me lately. There are a few reasons for this which I'm sure I'll write about another day. The short story though is that I'm currently loving it and in my spare time I volunteer as part of the core event team for [The Great Field parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/thegreatfield/) which is conveniently just a few minutes walk from my front door in Poundbury, Dorset.
